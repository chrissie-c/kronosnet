To: distribution package maintainers

Those are a few things about this project that you should know.

I surely welcome patches to support both in a better way.

DO NOT ship kronosnetd. It's an experimental piece of super
crappy code. IF you decide to ship it anyway, you get to
be also the upstream maintainer :-) you have been warned.

libnozzle is a simple commodity library used only by kronosnetd
and a future release of corosync. This is the first GA release
for libnozzle, please allow space for minor screw ups.

libknet is the core of this project. It is considered stable
and supported in the stable* branches and still under
heavy development in master branch. Upstream does guarantee
onwire and update compatibility between releases in the same
major versions (aka 1.x will always be able to talk to 1.x+n).
There is NO guarantee of onwire compatibility
between major versions of knet (aka: 1.x might not be able to talk
to 2.x).

libknet has a lot of build dependencies due to its modular
implementation. It does not, however, link with all those libraries
but uses a dlopen model to save runtime resources and provide
flexibility to users to install only the libraries they are
planning to use. Make sure that you do build with all feature
enabled (compatible with your distribution licencing/patent
policy of course) and tune your packaging to Recommend/Suggest
the external libraries.

Thanks
Your upstream maintainers
